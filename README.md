### Hacktoberfest 2022 for Treehouse TechDegree Students
# Project 2 - Multiple Choice Quiz App

Welcome to Hacktoberfest learners! This is one of the projects that we have created for you so you can experience Hacktoberfest in a safe and encouraging environment.

This project is a fun one! We are pulling together questions and answers to create a fun quiz app that you can use to sharpen those HTML/CSS skills. Users should be presented with a question and 4 possible answers. The app should serve up a number of questions and the user should be able to keep track of their score.

## Contributing (Please read!)
